Game currently under development. <br> Working on: Upgrades ▕█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▏<br><br>

Game is fully playable! Enemies and teammates will spawn randomly on the map. The current aim is to survive for as long as you can (health won't regenerate) but I will add score and win conditions later.Ships will drop resources when killed. Shooting and using abilities will now consume resources. Shield is the blue bar at the top and health is the grey bar below the shield bar. Shield will regen naturally but health will not. <br><br>
