# Spaceship-Game

https://grimreaper2654.github.io/Spaceship-Game/game/main.html <br>
Game currently under development. <br> Working on: UI ▕░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▏<br><br>

Game is fully playable! Enemies and teammates will spawn randomly on the map. THe current aim is to survive for as long as you can (health won't regenerate) but I will add score and win conditions later.<br><br>

press 'initialise' then 'start game' to start the game. Don't press 'start game' more than once. Use the test button to spawn more ships.<br>
W to accelerate<br>
S to decelerate<br>
A and D to rotate<br>
Q to switch aiming mode<br>
turrets follow mouse pointer <br>
Left click to shoot turrets <br>
E to shoot main cannon<br>
R to boost <br> <br>


NOTE: Zoom out to see more of the map at once. Moving too far from the start messes up the ship spawning code so try to stay near the start area. If no ships spawn even if you click the 'test' button, something is probably broken. Reload the game to fix it (probably)
