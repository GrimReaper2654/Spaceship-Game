# Spaceship-Game

https://grimreaper2654.github.io/Spaceship-Game/game/main.html <br>
Game currently under development. <br> Working on: Reworking Movement ▕████████████████░░░░▏<br><br>

Currently, spaceship is fully controllable. Enemies will spawn naturally but more can be spawned using the 'Add Ship' button. Friendly ships will also spawn and help the player.<br><br>

press 'initialise' then 'start game' to start the game. Don't press 'start game' more than once. <br>
W to accelerate<br>
S to decelerate<br>
A and D to rotate<br>
Q to switch aiming mode<br>
turrets follow mouse pointer <br>
Left click to shoot turrets <br>
E to shoot main cannon<br> <br>


NOTE: Zoom out to see more of the map at once. Moving too far from the start messes up the ship spawning code so try to stay near the start area.
