# Spaceship-Game

https://grimreaper2654.github.io/Spaceship-Game/game/main.html <br>
Game currently under development.<br><br>

Currently, spaceship can move and rotate.<br><br>

press 'initialise' then 'start game' to start the game. <br>
W to accelerate<br>
S to decelerate<br>
A and D to rotate<br>
Q to switch aiming mode<br>
turrets follow mouse pointer <br><br>
You can't shoot yet -_- <br>


NOTE: the size of the game area is based on your screen resolution so if your screen is small, it will be hard (impossible) to manoeuver the spaceship.
