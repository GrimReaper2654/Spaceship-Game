# Spaceship-Game

https://grimreaper2654.github.io/Spaceship-Game/game/main.html <br>
Game currently under development. <br> Working on: Improving Combat ▕███████████░░░░░░░░░░▏<br><br>

Currently, spaceship is fully controllable. Enemies will spawn naturally but more can be spawned using the 'Add Ship' button. Friendly ships will also spawn and help the player. The game is quite unbalanced at the moment but it should be fixed soon.<br><br>

press 'initialise' then 'start game' to start the game. Don't press 'start game' more than once. <br>
W to accelerate<br>
S to decelerate<br>
A and D to rotate<br>
Q to switch aiming mode<br>
turrets follow mouse pointer <br>
Left click to shoot turrets <br>
E to shoot main cannon<br> <br>


NOTE: the size of the game area is based on your screen resolution so if your screen is small, it will be hard (impossible) to manoeuver the spaceship. You can zoom out then reload the game to get a larger screen for the game.

AKA: Zoom out to have large FOV and map. (I will increase map size later)
